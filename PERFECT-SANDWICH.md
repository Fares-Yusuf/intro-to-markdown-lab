1. Using your knife, spread peanut butter on one slice of bread
2. Ensure even coverage from edge to edge
3. Use about 2 tablespoons of peanut butter
4. Butter (optional but recommended!) ~Butter makes everything better~
### Step 4: Add the Jelly
1. On the second slice, spread your preferred jelly
2. Use approximately 1-1.5 tablespoons of jelly
3. Spread evenly to all corners

### Step 5: Combine and Serve
1. Bring both slices together, with spreads facing inward
2. Press gently to secure
3. Toast in a pan or toaster for added crunch (optional)
3. Cut diagonally for the classic presentation (optional)

## Pro Tips
- Don't press too hard when spreading to avoid tearing the bread
- Store-bought bread works fine, but fresh bakery bread elevates the experience
- For extra flavor, try toasting the bread first
- Consider adding sliced bananas or honey for variation
